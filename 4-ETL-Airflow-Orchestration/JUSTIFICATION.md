# Justification about the dataset: **Air quality in Monterrey and Saltillo**.


Air quality in these metropolitan areas is a critical environment and public health issue in northern Mexico, where industrialization, vehicular traffic, and geographical conditions (such as closeed valleys) generate high levels of pullutants like PM2.5 contributing to thousands of cases of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases each year. 

Analyzing this historical dataset (`July 2023 - February 2025`) allows for the identification of seasonal patterns, the most affected monitoring stations, and trends of improvement or deterioration, which could drive more effective policies such as vehicle restrictions or incentives for clean transportation. The main beneficiaries are local communities (especially children and eldery people in vulnerable areas), environment authorities in `Nuevo Leon` and `Coahuila` for better urban planning, and public health in general by reducing unnecessary exposure.
